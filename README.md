Configuration
------------

Open up `config.json` and make the values correspond to your Twitter API credentials.

Change your Twitter Account settings to allow dm's from anybody.

Installation
------------
1: Find and Open up Command Prompt
	
2: In Command Prompt Run: pip install TwitterAPI

	Errors: Search Google. Typically it's about python not being installed correctly.
